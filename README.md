# Pipex
The 42 project pipex asks us to reproduce the behavior of the Unix terminal’s pipe operator “|” in C. This symbol redirects the standard output of one process to the standard input of another. We will learn three important things in this project: how to execute shell commands from our C program, how to create and manage child processes as well as how to handle their file descriptors.
